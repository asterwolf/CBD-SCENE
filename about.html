          <h3>What Is CBD?</h3>
          <p>CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a chemical compound from the Cannabid sativa plant, whish is also known as marijuana or hemp.</p>
          <p>It's a naturally occurring substance that's used in products like oils and edibles to impart a feeling of relaxation and calm.</p>
        <hr>
          <h3>What does CBD help with??</h3>
          <p>CBD helps with a wide variety of issues.</p>
          <h4>Pain</h4>
          <p>People tend to use prescription or over-the-counter drugs to relieve stiffness and pain, including chronic pain.

              Some people believe that CBD offers a more natural alternative.

              Authors of a studyTrusted Source published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine found that CBD significantly reduced chronic inflammation and pain in some mice and rats.

              The researchers suggested that the non-psychoactive compounds in marijuana, such as CBD, could provide a new treatment for chronic pain.</p>
          <h4>Quitting Smoking and Drug Withdrawls</h4>
          <p>Some promising evidence suggests that CBD use may help people to quit smoking.

              A pilot studyTrusted Source published in Addictive Behaviors found that smokers who used inhalers containing CBD smoked fewer cigarettes than usual and had no further cravings for nicotine.

              A similar review,Trusted Source published in Neurotherapeutics found that CBD may be a promising treatment for people with opioid addiction disorders.

              The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders. These included anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia.

              More research is necessary, but these findings suggest that CBD may help to prevent or reduce withdrawal symptoms.</p>
          <h4>Neurological Symptoms and Disorders</h4>
          <p>Researchers are studying the effects of CBD on various neuropsychiatric disorders.

              Findings suggested that CBD may also treat many complications linked to epilepsy, such as neurodegeneration, neuronal injury, and psychiatric diseases.

              Another study,Trusted Source published in Current Pharmaceutical Design, found that CBD may produce effects similar to those of certain antipsychotic drugs, and that the compound may provide a safe and effective treatment for people with schizophrenia. However, further research is necessary.</p>
          <h4>Fighting Cancer</h4>
          <p>Some researchers have found that CBD may prove to combat cancer.

              Authors of a reviewTrusted Source published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology found evidence that CBD significantly helped to prevent the spread of cancer.

              The researchers also noted that the compound tends to suppress the growth of cancer cells and promote their destruction.

              They pointed out that CBD has low levels of toxicity. They called for further research into its potential as an accompaniment to standard cancer treatments.</p>

          <h3>Does CBD get you high?</h3>
          <p>Unlike its cousin, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the major active ingredient in marijuana, CBD is not psychoactive.</p>
